As of this writing, MinGW does not yet have the CryptProtectData and CryptUnprotectData
headers in wincrypt.h so you will need the Microsoft .NET command line compiler.

You'll also need to install the Microsoft Platform SDK which contains all the necessary
headers and library files.  Once you have this installed, create an environment
variable called SDK_HOME that points to the SDK directory.


To build, run:
mvn clean package assembly:assembly
